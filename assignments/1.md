## Homework Assignment #1

#### 1.1         
The basic tasks that all software engineering projects must handle are (1) requirements gathering, (2) high level design, (3) low level design, (4) development, (5) testing, (6) deployment, (7) maintenance, and (8) wrap-up.
 
#### 1.2        
Requirements gathering is figuring out what your customers want and what your customers need.            
High level design is designing the large pieces of the project and deciding how they interact, for example, what platform the application should be for (desktop, tablet, or phone).                    
Low level design is deciding how each piece of the project should work so that the pieces can be implemented.                
Development is the writing of the code of the application.                    
Testing is affirming that the code works by writing tests and using the application in multiple ways to look for bugs.                  
Deployment is rolling out the project for the customers to use.                          
Maintenance is fixing bugs, making the application better through adding features or making it more efficient.                    
Wrap-up is evaluating the project to see what went right and what went wrong so the developers can learn lessons and do more things right in the future.

#### 2.5           
Just Barely Good Enough (JBGE) is the coding school of thought that you shouldn’t write any more comments or documentation than absolutely necessary so that you don’t have to waste time updating them when changes are made.

#### 3.2             
The critical path is G, D, E, M, Q. This will take 6 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 4 = 32 days.

#### 3.4            
Work will be finished on February 18th.

#### 3.6              
Unpredictable problems should be planned for. You can do this by adding tasks to the end of your Gantt chart without saying what they are for. So when an unpredictable problem comes up, you can allocate one of those slots to deal with the issue.

#### 3.8                  
The biggest mistake is assuming you will complete a task on time even if it taking longer than you expected. You probably won’t make up the time and will end up behind schedule. Instead of ignoring the problem, take some action. 
The second biggest mistake is adding more developers to a task in order to make the task be finished faster. Adding more developers often makes the task take longer because effort is needed to bring them up to speed.

#### 4.1             
Good requirements are (1) clear, (2) unambiguous, (3) consistent, (4) prioritized, and (5) verifiable.

#### 4.3                    
Audience oriented categories: Business, User, Functional, Nonfunctional, and Implementation.                     
                      
a. Allow users to monitor uploads/downloads while away from the office. (Business)              
b. Let the user specify website log-in parameters such as an Internet address, a port, a username, and a password. (User, Functional)        
c. Let the user specify upload/download parameters such a number of retries if there's a problem. (User, Functional)               
d. Let the user select an Internet location, a local file, and a time to perform the upload/download. (User, Functional)                
e. Let the user schedule uploads/downloads at any time. (Nonfunctional)                     
f. Allow uploads/downloads to run at any time. (Nonfunctional)                    
g. Make uploads/downloads transfer at least 8 Mbps. (Nonfunctional)                       
h. Run uploads/downloads sequentially. Two cannot run at the same time. (Nonfunctional)               
i. If an upload/download is scheduled for a time whan another is in progress, it waits until the other one finishes. (Nonfunctional)           
j. Perform schedule uploads/downloads. (Functional)                    
k. Keep a log of all attempted uploads/downloads and whether the succeeded. (Functional)                       
l. Let the user empty the log. (User, Functional)                         
m. Display reports of upoad/download attempts. (User, Functional)                   
n. Let the user view the log reports on a remote device such as a phone. (User, Functional)                    
o. Send an e-mail to an administrator if an upload/download fails more than its maximum retry number of times. (User, Functional)                     
p. Send a text message to an administrator if an upload/download fails more than it's maximum retury umber of times. (User, Functional)                     
                          
There are requirements in every category except Implementation. Implementation has no requirements because the requirements are for transitioning to the new system and after you have bought the necessary hardware and started using the new software, these requirements go away.

#### 4.9                  
Possible improvements:                        
Keeping score of number of wins and losses a player has. (S)                  
Better graphics for the buttons and skeleton. (C)                      
Have different levels of difficulty for the player to choose from. (C)                       
Having a leaderboard that compares a player’s win-loss ratio to other players that play the game. (W)                        
Have animations for when the player makes a guess, wins, or loses. (W)
